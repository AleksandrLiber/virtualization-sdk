# Schemas and Autogenerated Classes

[Plugin operations](/References/Plugin_Operations) will sometimes need to work with data in these custom formats. For example, the `configure` operation will accept snapshot data as an input, and must produce source config data as an output.

To enable this, Python classes are generated from the snapshot schema. The aforementioned inputs and outputs are instances of these autogenerated classes.

## SourceConfigDefinition

Defines properties used to identify a [Source Config](Glossary.md#source-config).

### SourceConfigDefinition Schema

The plugin must also decide on a **name** field and a set of **identityFields** to display and uniquely identify the data set that this represents.

!!! note
    Be careful in your choice of identity fields! Imagine a situation in which either the **port** or **name** of a running Delphix DB instance is modified. The modified database instance will still represent the same data as it did prior to being updated. If the Delphix Engine ever reruns discovery, the currently tracked source config should simply be updated such that its **path** reflects the update. Therefore, we would not want to include these fields in the set of identity fields.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["name"],
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "path": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "identityFields": ["name"],
  "nameField": "name"
}
```

### SourceConfigDefinition Class

Autogenerated based on the [SourceConfigDefinition Schema](#sourceconfigdefinition-schema).

```python
class SourceConfigDefinition:

  def __init__(self, config_name, config_path):
    self._inner_dict = {"name": config_name, "path": config_path}
```

> To use the class:

```python
import dlpx
from dlpx.virtualization.generated import SourceConfigDefinition

source_config = SourceConfigDefinition()
name = source_config.name
path = source_config.path
```

## VirtualSourceDefinition

Defines properties used to [virtual sources](#Glossary.md#virtual-source).

### VirtualSourceDefinition Schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["name"],
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "port": { "type": "integer" }
}
```

### VirtualSourceDefinition Class

Autogenerated based on the [VirtualSourceDefinition Schema](#virtualsourcedefinition-schema).

```python
class VirtualSourceDefinition:

  def __init__(self, source_name, source_port):
    self._inner_dict = {"name": source_name, "port": source_port}
```

> To use the class:


```python
import dlpx
from dlpx.virtualization.generated import VirtualSourceDefinition

source = VirtualSourceDefinition()
name = source.name
port = source.port
```
