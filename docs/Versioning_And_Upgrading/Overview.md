# Overview

At some point after you've made the initial release of your plugin, you'll want to release a new version with new features and/or bug fixes. The plugin upgrade process enables this.

## Plugin Versioning

Like any other piece of software, plugins change over time. Every so often, there will be a new release. To keep track of the different releases, each plugin release has its own versioning information. Depending on what changes are included in a particular release, there are different rules and recommendations for how the versioning information should be changed. More information on versioning is located [here](Versioning.md).

## Upgrading

Upgrading is the process by which an older version of a plugin is replaced by a newer version. Depending on what has changed between the two versions, this process may also include modifying data that was written using the old plugin, so that it conforms to the schemas found in the new version of the plugin. Information on the upgrade process can be found [here](Upgrading.md).
