# Release Notes - 0.4.0

## New + Improved

* Added a new CLI command [download_logs](/References/CLI/#download_logs) to download plugin generated logs from the Delphix Engine.
* Added an optional argument `check` to [platform library](/References/Platform_Libraries/) functions. When `check=true`, the platform library function validates the result and raises an exception if the function call was not successful.
* Modified CLI command `init` to auto-generate default implementations of all required plugin operations. 
* Improved CLI [build](/References/CLI/#build) validation for:
  * Required plugin operations.
  * Incorrect plugin operation arguments.
  * Plugin Config fields: `entryPoint` and `schemaFile`.
* Improved runtime validation and error messages for:
  * Objects returned from plugin operations.
  * Platform Classes during instantiation.
  * Plugin Library function arguments.
* Added support for Docker based plugins by using `rootSquashEnabled: false` in the [plugin config](/References/Plugin_Config/).
* Added Job and thread information to plugin generated log messages to increase diagnosability and observability.

## Breaking Changes

* Added a new argument `snapshot_parameters` to a couple of plugin operations. This argument will allow the end user to indicate to the plugin whether or not to initiate a full ingestion of the dSource. More details about this argument are [here](/Building_Your_First_Plugin/Data_Ingestion/).The following plugin operations would have to be updated in the plugin source code to add the new argument and match the updated method signatures, failing to do so would cause errors during the [build](/References/CLI/#build):
    * [Staged Linked Source Pre-Snapshot](/References/Plugin_Operations/#staged-linked-source-pre-snapshot)
    * [Staged Linked Source Post-Snapshot](/References/Plugin_Operations/#staged-linked-source-post-snapshot)
* [StagedSource](/References/Classes/#stagedsource) properties have been modified and all accesses to these fields would need to be updated in the plugin source code, failing to do so would cause failures at runtime if an invalid field is accessed: 
    * `connection` has been modified to `source_connection`.
    * `staged_connection` has been added to allow connecting to the staging environment.
  
## Fixed

* Allow access to nested package resources via `pkgutil.get_data`.
* Fixed Out of Memory exceptions.
* Fixed missing or incorrectly populated fields for the following classes:

    | Class | Field |
    | ----- | ----- |
    | [VirtualSource](/References/Classes/#virtualsource) | `mounts` |
    | RemoteUser | `name` |
    | RemoteEnvironment | `name` |
    | RemoteHost | `name` `binary_path` |

* Plugin generated logs should not be interspersed with Delphix Engine logs.
* Recreate the plugin's log directory if a plugin is deleted and re-uploaded to the Delphix Engine.
* Mark incorrectly provisioned VDBs as unusable.
* Better error messages when incorrect environment types are used for Platform Libraries.
* Better error messages when a plugin's `schemaFile` is updated and the plugin is re-uploaded to the Delphix Engine, with clear instructions on how to proceed.
* Fixed failures on Windows for CLI command `build`.
